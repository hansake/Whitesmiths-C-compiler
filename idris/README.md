Idris was an operating system developed by Whitesmiths.
The C and Pascal compilers are are included with the Idris operating system,
as well as a lot of other "Unix like" programs and utilities.

I found recently some old diskettes with the CO-IDRIS operating system version 2.37 for PC/MS-DOS on IBM PC that I was running many years ago.
I have created a virtual machine in VirtualBox running CO-IDRIS in VirtualBox from some very dusty old diskettes.
The VirtualBox I am using runs on a Linux Mint machine, but I expect that it may also run under Windows.

I am also in the process of scanning the comprehensive set of manuals that
were shippped with the Idris operating system.
