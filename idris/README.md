Idris was an operating system developed by Whitesmiths

[Idris (operating system) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(operating_system))

As I had access to the CO-IDRIS implementation for PC/MS-DOS on IBM PC I am trying to
create a virtual machine running CO-IDRIS in VirtualBox from some very dusty old diskettes.

I am also in the process of scanning the very comprehensive set of manuals that
were shippped with the Idris operating system.
