Idris was an operating system developed by Whitesmiths.
The C and Pascal compilers are are included with the Idris operating system,
as well as a lot of other "Unix like" programs and utilities.

As I had access to the CO-IDRIS implementation for PC/MS-DOS on IBM PC I am trying to
create a virtual machine running CO-IDRIS in VirtualBox from some very dusty old diskettes.

I am also in the process of scanning the very comprehensive set of manuals that
were shippped with the Idris operating system.
