This is the virtual machine for CO-IDRIS running in VirtualBox.

The exported VM filename is: co-idris_ms-dos.ova
(this VM image will be updated soon with some added tools.)

When VirtualBox is installed, open co-idris_ms-dos.ova to import the VM.
Then start the VM, MS-DOS 6.22 will boot.

Start Idris with the batch file IDR.BAT

 C:\>idr

return to DOS with the command quit

 \# quit
