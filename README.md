# Whitesmiths, Ltd. C Compiler

The original Whitesmiths compiler was released in 1978 and compiled a version of C similar
to that accepted by Version 6 Unix. It was an entirely new implementation, borrowing no code from Unix.

When Whitesmiths released version 3.0 of its C compiler in 1985 it supported the emerging ANSI C standard.

The Whitesmiths compiler had code generators for DEC PDP-11, Intel 8080/Zilog Z80, Intel 8086, Motorola MC68000,
DEC VAX-11, IBM System/370 and IBM System/36. It was commonly used as a cross compiler.

The company's president from 1978 to 1988 was P. J. Plauger.

I recieved an e-mail reply from P.J. Plauger on 3 Apr 2021 where he is positive to
making the compiler available for download.

I own all rights to the Whitesmiths C compiler. if you want to go to the trouble
to package it so that it can be downloaded from such a site, II'll be happy to
supply you with a letter giving limited rights to use it at no cost, at least for
non-commerecial purposes, provided you supply me with a copy of the
package you make.

Glad you're still active after all these decades. I am too, but definitely slowed
down by age.

Best regards,

P.J. Plauger

I have tried to get in contact with him to confirm that it is ok to put the
C compiler in a public repository, but unfortunately I have not got any answer yet.
