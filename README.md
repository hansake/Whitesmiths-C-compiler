# Whitesmiths, Ltd. C Compiler

The original Whitesmiths compiler was released in 1978 and compiled a version of C similar
to that accepted by Version 6 Unix. It was an entirely new implementation, borrowing no code from Unix.

When Whitesmiths released version 3.0 of its C compiler in 1985 it supported the emerging ANSI C standard.

The Whitesmiths compiler had code generators for DEC PDP-11, Intel 8080/Zilog Z80, Intel 8086, Motorola MC68000,
DEC VAX-11, IBM System/370 and IBM System/36. It was commonly used as a cross compiler.


In a mail from P.J Plauger he is positive to put code and documentation
for the Whitesmiths C compilers in a public repository.

Documentation and some code for the Idris operating system is also here.
Idris was a Unix like operating system developed by Whitesmiths Ltd.
