NAME
    ccpm80 - Install Guide for CP/M Native C Compiler

SYNOPSIS
    make three "minimum diskettes" labeled "compiler", "util" and "work"
    mount "compiler" in drive a: and "ccpm80 disk 2" in drive b:
    A>pip a:=b:*.*
    mount "util" in drive a: and "ccpm80 disk 1" in drive b:
    A>pip a:=b:*.*
    mount "work" in drive a: and "util" in drive b:
    A>submit b:buildu
    mount "compiler" in drive b:
    A>submit b:buildc
    A>submit test

FUNCTION
    The  installation  package for 2.2 ccpm80 consists of 33 files, written on
    two single density diskettes ("ccpm80 disk 1" and "ccpm80 disk 2").

    The installation procedure is designed to work under  the  most  stringent
    environment  under CP/M, i.e., two single density diskette drives.  If you
    have double density drives or a hard disk, you may modify the installation
    procedure and compiler scripts accordingly.

    A "minimum diskette" consists of a CP/M boot, and the two  CP/M  utilities
    pip.com  and  submit.com.   The  "compiler" disk will contain the compiler
    passes and the assembler.  The "util" disk will contain numerous utilities
    that are not required for normal operation.  The "work disk  will  contain
    the linker, libraries, header files, and command scripts.

    If  all goes well, test will try out the new compiler by compiling echo.c;
    it will then use the newly created echo to announce that the  installation
    succeeded.

    Before  extracting  anything  from  the  media, or building/installing the
    software, the Whitesmiths, Ltd. Software Authorization  Seal  (located  on
    the  inside  back  cover of the C Programmers' Manual) must be permanently
    affixed to the device in which a copy of the software will be retained.

    The files are:

    ccpm80 disk 1:
    anat.o -- the A-Natural translator
    buildu.sub -- script to build the utilities and libraries
    cpm.o -- the CP/M diskette utility
    crts.80 -- the C runtime startup module
    dis80.o -- the Whitesmiths 8080 object file disassembler
    hex.o -- a utility to convert from Whitesmiths object files to ASCII
    lib.o -- the Whitesmiths librarian
    libc.80 -- the C library
    limit -- notice of limited warranty
    link.com -- executable version of the linker
    link.o -- the Whitesmiths linker
    lord.o -- the library ordering utility

    rel.o -- relocatable object module utility

    ccpm80 disk 2:
    as.o -- the 8080 A-Natural assembler
    buildc.sub -- script to build the compiler and assembler
    c.sub -- the C compiler driver script
    cpm.h -- header file for interfacing with CP/M
    cright -- Whitesmiths Ltd. copyright notice
    ctype.h -- header for character types
    echo.c -- a sample C program
    echo.doc -- documentation for echo.c
    instal.doc -- this document
    ld.sub -- script for linking C programs under CP/M
    libu.80 -- Unix style i/o library (v7 lib)
    math.h -- header for math function definitions
    p0.o -- the C preprocessor
    p1.o -- the C parser
    p2.o -- the C code generator for 8080's
    std.h -- Whitesmiths standard header
    stdio.h -- header for Unix style i/o
    stdtyp.h -- alternate type definitions for use with libu
    test.sub -- script to test the new compiler
    utext.h -- header for unsigned TEXT

    It is strongly recommended that the build scripts be read before they  are
    executed,  to  make  sure  that  they  do  not interfere with any existing
    systems.  Once the dust has settled, the following files should be left in
    place.

    On the "util" disk:
    anat.com        cpm.com         dis80.com       hex.com
    lib.com         lord.com        rel.com

    On the "compiler" disk:
    as80.com        pp.com          p1.com          p2.com

    On the "work" disk:
    c.sub           cpm.h           crts.80         ctype.h
    ld.sub          libc.80         libu.80         link.com
    math.h          std.h           stdio.h         stdtyp.h
    utext.h

    If "Unix style i/o" support is not  required,  ctype.h,  math.h,  stdio.h,
    stdtyp.h  and  libu.80 may be deleted from the "work" disk.  Note that the
    reference to libu.80 in ld.sub should also be deleted.

SEE ALSO
    Compiling, linking, and running C programs is dealt with in the  C  Inter-
    face Manual for 8080.  The C language proper, and a detailed specification
    of the portable C library, are to be found in the C Programmers' Manual.

BUGS
    Due  to  naming  limitations,  several files must be installed under names
    that differ from those used in the documentation.  The following is a list
