HOW TO BUILD A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF C/36
=======================================

============
* COMPILER *
============

If the compiler is changed then move it to virtual disk E:\C36\P236.EXE
and make a new distribution diskette with the batch file E:\MKCDISK.BAT
this will format a diskette in B: and transfer files to it.

	CD E:\
	MKCDISK

=============
* LIBRARIES *
=============

On Idris11
==========

Build a new version on Idris11 with

	/wsl/l30/cmds/doit.36

On Idris11/PC
=============

transfer all library files to IBM PC-XT using a virtual disk E:
Disk E: is on a file on S/36 named PCDISKE.

/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/liba/* --kermit--> E:\LIBA
/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/libb/* --kermit--> E:\LIBB
/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/libc/* --kermit--> E:\LIBC
/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/libm/* --kermit--> E:\LIBM
/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/libw/* --kermit--> E:\LIBW
/wsl/l30/ship/86/dos/pkg/cssp36/libp/* --kermit--> E:\LIBP

move all changed header files to E:\C36\HDRS
move all changed system interface source files to E:\C36\SYSINT

On S/36
=======

To move assembler files to S/36 and assemble them there run:

	ASMLIBS

(this will disable the printer spool writer and take quite a while,
after this job is done, cancel all entries in the spool file and
restart the spool writer)

Then move the object files to libraries:

	BUILDLIB

The libraries than has to be transfered to pc-disk files.

1.	make temporary work files with:

	MKWRKFIL

2.	switch to pc mode

On PC
=====

3.	format and transfer C libraries to disk 2 and 3.

	E>MKPCDISK

4.	if you also make Pascal, format and transfer library to disk.

	E>MKPCPDSK
