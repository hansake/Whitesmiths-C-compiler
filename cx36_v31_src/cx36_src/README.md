# IBM S/36 code generatots and assembler

I have now been able to compile the S/36 code generator for Whitesmiths C.

For some strange reason I also developed a cross assembler based on RTS xa8 when I developed the compiler in 1985. 
When looking into the source code I found this assembler and I could not resist making a variant of the code generator 
that generates assembler code (non IBM) for this cross assembler.
