# Whitesmiths code generator for IBM S/36

The source and Makefiles for the IBM S/36 code generators are in the directory: cx36_src

I have also included the QEMU MS-DOS image I used for compiling.
* c-s36-msdos.img.zip is the compressed MS-DOS image.
* c-s36-msdos.sh starts QEMU with this image on Linux.
