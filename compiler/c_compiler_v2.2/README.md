This directory contains the source code for Whitesmiths C compiler edition 2.2.
It also contains Makefiles to cross compile a compiler for CP/M.
I have used a cross compiler ported to a modern 64 bit system by Mike Ogden.

To build a C compiler package for CP/M on 8080 run this command on the top level of the file tree:
* make distr
The package is then available under ccpm80/distr

To build the compiler but not copy to the distribution directory, just run:
* make
The compiler components are then available under ccpm80/build

To clean up the build directory:
* make clean

To clean up the build and distribution directories:
* make distclean
