NAME
   int0.h - header file for C preprocessor

FUNCTION
   int0.h contains structure definitions and constants  used  only  by  the  C
   preprocessor.

   LEX  -  is  an  int  used to hold token codes, e.g. PCHCON, which are never
        zero.

   INCL - is a structure used to control an open  file.  next  points  to  any
        pending  files,  if  this  is an include file. fname is either NULL or
        points to an allocated filename, for diagnostics. nline is the current
        line number in the file, for diagnostics.  pfio  is  the  FIO  control
        buffer for the file.

   PRETAB  -  is  the  structure  used  for  predefined  tables  of  keywords,
        operators, etc. prename points to the name string, which begins with a
        byte containing length of the string, to save scanning  the  name  for
        its  terminating  null.  pretype  is  the  encoded  token type, always
        non-zero. PRETAB arrays must be sorted on the prename strings.

   TLIST - is the structure of an entry in the token  list  used  to  describe
        input  lines  and  definitions.  Each  entry  represents  zero or more
        characters of leading whitespace, followed by zero or more  characters
        of  the  actual  token;  PEOL is the only token with a length of zero.
        next points to the next item in the list.  type  is  the  token  type,
        always  non-zero;  token lists invariably end in an EOL token. type is
        one of: PCHCON for '...', PEOL for end of line, PIDENT for identifier,
        PNUM for number, PPUNCT for  punctuation,  PSTRING  for  "...".  white
        points  at  the  whitespace  string preceding the token. nwhite is the
        number of whitespace characters starting at white. text points to  the
        start  of  the  defining  text  for  the token. ntext is the number of
        characters in the text string.

   ALIST - is the structure of an argument list element for the expansion of a
        macro with arguments. next points to the next argument. astart  points
        at  the  first  token  in  the argument token list. aend points at the
        first token beyond the argument token list.

   DEF - is the symbol table structure for #defines. next points to  the  next
        older  entry  in  this  definition  list.  dnlen  is the length of the
        definition name. defn points to the  first  token  in  the  definition
        token list; it is always non-NULL. dname is the definition name.

   ARGS - is the structure filled in by getflags for the -d arguments from the
        command  line.  ntop is the index of the highest free entry in anames;
        zero implies full. anames is the array of text pointers  for  each  of
        the arguments, filled in from the top down.
