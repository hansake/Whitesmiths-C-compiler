NAME
   int01.h - interface between C preprocessor and p1

FUNCTION
   The C processor passes a stream of lexemes to the C  compiler  p1.  int01.h
   defines the language of these lexemes.

   KEYWORDS  -  lexemes  may be one of the C keywords: AUTO, BREAK, CASE, etc.
        keywords are distinguished from other lexemes by having the  0040  bit
        set.  Additions to the KEYWORD table should take care that this bit is
        set. LSIZEOF is branded a pseudo keyword  because  its  encoding  must
        also  be  compatible  with  that  of  operators  defined  in int012.h.
        Similarly, the created lexemes of  p1  are  listed  here  to  minimize
        future  errors  due  to  oversight:  DARG is an argument, DEXTERN is a
        defined extern, DSTATIC is a defined static, and  FSTATIC  is  a  file
        local static.

   CONSTANTS   -  Lexemes  other  than  keywords  or  punctuation  are  called
        constants, and consist of more than one character. p1 can test for the
        next lexeme being a 'constant' by:

                if ((MASK & lexeme) == CONS)

   additions to the CONS table must ensure that the above relationship  holds.
   Constants are:

           LDNUM	+ 8 byte double constant
           LIDENT	+ 1 byte 'n' + 'n' bytes id name
           LIFILE	+ 1 byte 'n' + 'n' bytes file name
           LLINENO	+ 2 byte linenumber in current file
           LLNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (long)
           LSNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (short)
           LSTRING	+ 2 byte 'n' + 'n' bytes string 
           LCNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (char)
           LULNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (unsigned long)
           LUSNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (unsigned short)
           LUCNUM	+ 4 byte long constant (unsigned char)

   All  numbers are encoded as for the host machine; hence both pp and p1 must
   be run on the same machine.

   A null byte, or end of file, signals end of stream.

   PUNCTUATION - Lexemes may be  C  punctuation  characters:  LCOLON,  LCOMMA,
        LDOT, etc.
