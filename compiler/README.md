The Whitesmiths C compiler for CP/M-80 in binary format is available in the "ccpm80_bin" directory.

The source for the CP/M-80 compiler and Makefiles to build it are available in the "c_compiler_v2.2" directory.

Documentation is available in the "doc" directory.

I got a mail from P.J. Plauger giving limited rights to use the software at no cost provided that it
is not used commercially.
