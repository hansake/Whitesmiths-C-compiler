The Whitesmiths C Compiler for CP/M-80 Edition 2.2 in binary format is available in the "ccpm80_bin" directory.

The source for the CP/M-80 Compiler Edition 2.2 and Makefiles to build it are available in the "c_compiler_v2.2" directory.
The intention is the the source should be for edition 2.2 but there might be some source coming from other releases.

Documentation is available in the "doc" directory.

In a mail from P.J Plauger he is positive to put code and documentation for the Whitesmiths C compilers in a public repository
for use at no cost provided that it is not used commercially.
