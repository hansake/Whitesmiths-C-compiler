The CX36 directory contains binary program files for the S/36 C compiler hosted on MS-DOS.

The file c-s36-msdos.img.zip can be unzipped and run with QEMU.

There are two shell scripts for starting the emulation:
* c-s36-msdos.sh
* c-s36-msdos_ddsk.sh

The compiler was shipped on three diskettes but on the copy I found,
everything was on one diskette, i.e. the content of CX36.
